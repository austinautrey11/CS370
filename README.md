Artificial Intelligence using Reinforcement Learning
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was basically given a lot of code that would do most of the major heavy lifting for this project. I was given the responsibiity of training the 
neural network to account for loss, and how to train the agent through reinforcement learning.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

Learning through this course has really helped me learn from a more ethical point in computer science.
It has showed me what some of these deep learning algorithms are capable of, and how they can use our data.
It has made me realize that I want to work from the highest ethical standards in computer science, no matter how hard that might be.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists do a wide range of things from writing software, testing software, working in cybersecurity to defend our cyberspace
to much more. It is really way to much to explain. We keep technology up and running, while also improving it each and every day.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach it first from an ethical standpoint. I would then move in from there in an analytical way.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities our to protect the users data in every way possible. 
Also to build and use algorithms that are not going to spy on the user or manipulate their data.
